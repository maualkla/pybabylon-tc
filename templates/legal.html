<h2>What are cookies?</h2>

<h2>How we use cookies</h2>

<p>
    We use cookies for the following purposes:   
</p>

<p>Essential Cookies: These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly. They enable basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of the website.   
</p>
<p>Functionality Cookies: These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your language preference) and provide enhanced, more personal features.   
</p>
<p>Performance Cookies: These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages.

<h2>Managing your cookie preferences</h2>
<p>You can manage your cookie preferences through your browser settings. Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings, such as login information.

<p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.
